# Creating a snowman

According to Systems Programming course - this is my first implementation for the first part of the assignment.
Followed by the following instructions:
https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/49671/12019

* snowman.hpp -> function name.
* Demo.cpp file -> A basic implementation - not a full implementation - only for compilation.
* Test.cpp -> Implementation of 20 Tests.

I followed those commands for recieving a great feedback without any warnings.

    make demo
    ./demo
	make test
    ./test
